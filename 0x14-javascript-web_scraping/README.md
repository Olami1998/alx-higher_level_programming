# 0x14. JavaScript - Web Scraping

Welcome to 0x14 JavaScript - Web Scraping! This project covers various web scraping techniques using JavaScript, the most popular programming language in the world. In this project, you will sharpen your web scraping skills using the popular scraping library, [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/). You will be able to crawl websites, extract information and automate testing and other tasks with ease.


In this repository, you will find 9 separate tasks that explore different aspects of web scraping. These tasks start from basic web scraping techniques to more advanced concepts like web server access, handling of HTTP requests and responses, data persistence, and Twitter search.

## Tasks

1. [0-readme.js](./0-readme.js) - This introductory task requires you to create this very README.md file. To complete this task, you need to write an advanced and catchy description for each task.

2. [1-writeme.js](./1-writeme.js) - In this task, you will create a script that writes a string to a file.

3. [2-statuscode.js](./2-statuscode.js) - This task involves creating a script that displays the status code of a GET request.

4. [3-starwars_title.js](./3-starwars_title.js) - Task number four requires you to create a script that prints the title of a Star Wars movie where the episode number matches a given integer.

5. [4-starwars_count.js](./4-starwars_count.js) - In task number five, you will create a script that prints the number of movies where the character "Wedge Antilles" is present.

6. [5-request_store.js](./5-request_store.js) - In this task, you are required to create a script that gets data from an API and saves it to a file.

7. [6-completed_tasks.js](./6-completed_tasks.js) - In task number seven, you will create a script that computes the number of tasks completed by a user when given their completed todo list.

8. [100-starwars_characters.js](./100-starwars_characters.js) - This advanced task requires you to create a script that prints the list of characters from Star Wars films based on a given film ID.

9. [101-starwars_characters.js](./101-starwars_characters.js) - In this task, you need to create a script that prints the list of characters from Star Wars films based on a given character ID.

10. [102-search_twitter.js](./102-search_twitter.js) - The final task requires you to create a script that, given a search string, lists the 5 most recent tweets related to that string.

## Conclusion

Web scraping is a powerful technique that can be used to extract data from websites efficiently. With JavaScript, you can easily and programmatically access websites and extract data, making web scraping easier and faster than ever before. We hope that this project gives you a good introduction to web scraping with JavaScript and encourages you to explore this fascinating field further!
